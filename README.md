# Portfolio inspiration

## Overview

Look for **5 or more** things that you think would be appropriate for your portfolio:

- Find components on websites
- Find user experiences
- Find colour palettes
- Find text descriptions
- Find layouts
- *Find whatever…*

**Write a quick sentence on each thing you find explaining why it’s appropriate for your website or why it inspires you.** *You’ll be showing this inspiration board to the teacher.*
